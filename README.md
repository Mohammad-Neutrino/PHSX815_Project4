# PHSX815_Project4

This repository contains four branches:
   1. main: where Project4.pdf is the writeup for project 4.
   2. Data: where .txt files containing a bunch of distribution data is stored.
   3. Codes: where three .py files are there (a) decay.py (b) decay_mixture.py (c) decay_likelihood.py 
   
      These codes can be run from the terminal as:path/to/file:~$ python code_name.py
      
   4. Plots: where all the plots are saved
